    <p>Hello everyone! I'm excited to be in this class and to learn about web fundamentals with you all. I am an accounting major, with a minor in computer science, so this class is one that is not one that I expected to ever take. However, after the initial activities I feel a lot more excited about all that I am to learn here this semester. </p>
    <p>I am from The Woodlands, Texas, near Houston, but I have been up it school here for a couple of years. I love BYU-Idaho and the church's efforts to help us get en education. I am so grateful for this gospel and all of the worldy and heavenly blessings it provides me. I come from a family of seven, including parents, and I love them all so much!</p>
    <p>My hope is to be able to be in the accounting field one day, but I love computer science and am anxious to learn more about it. Because I don't find accounting super fun, it's nice to have something interesting to learn about on the side. Thank you for reading my page, and I look forward to getting to know some of you!</p>
    <p>Good luck this semester!</p>
