            <h2>My name is Kimball Christensen. I have grown up a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was baptized at eight years old, and since then I have stayed active in the church. Ever since I can remember, the Book of Mormon has been taught as a significant part of my relationship with Christ. Many people are under the impression that in the Church, there is a lot of pressure to live a certain way. </h2>

            <h2>I have always made the choice, however, to find the truth for myself by studying Christian texts and then asking God for His help in revealing the truth to me. As I have done this throughout my life, I have come to know more about Godâ€™s plan for me. My study of the Book of Mormon has allowed me to come closer to Christ and feel His love more often. I know that there are many like me out there who have found the same peace in life through their honest, faith-filled efforts to know the truth. I suggest that any and all who have a need for this in their life do the same thing.</h2>
