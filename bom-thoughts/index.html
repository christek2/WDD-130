            <h2>This is an introduction to the Book of Mormon for anyone who may be curious to learn more. The Book of Mormon is one of the most important aspects of the gospel as taught in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is, as we call it, the “keystone” of our religion - meaning it holds it all together as the keystone in an arch holds up the two sides.</h2>

            <h2>It was translated through the power of God from ancient texts written by people in the Americas from 600 BC to about 400 AD. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has many teachings, with the Book of Mormon at its core. There is a great responsibility for each member to read and study this book, since its truthfulness testifies of many things: the restoration of God’s priesthood, the calling of His prophet, the reorganization of His church, and more. All of this occurred while the Book of Mormon was being translated by Joseph Smith, through the power of God. If it is true, it is because God led him to restore His church and was with him throughout the whole process.</h2>
