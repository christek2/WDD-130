            <h2>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the church of Jesus Christ reorganized on this earth. Its members follow Christ and claim to adhere to His teachings. With this in mind. It’s important to note that the members of the Church do believe in the Holy Bible – both the Old and New Testaments. But, they also believe that the Book of Mormon contains the word of God. In fact, it is a pillar of belief that, as time goes on, Christ reveals more of His gospel to His people, and that the Book of Mormon is the biggest thing revealed in this time to uncover more of the gospel. </h2>

            <h2>There are some things that are unclear or not included at all in the Bible which are explained in the Book of Mormon. Hand in hand, these two religious texts compliment each other. All Christians know that Christ lived at a certain time and in a certain place, and that time and place are talked about at length in the Bible. That is where His life is laid out for believers to study. The Book of Mormon, then, does not talk about this (having taken place in America), but instead is given through the view point of other prophet called by God. Two peoples, two different sides of the world, but the same gospel.</h2>
