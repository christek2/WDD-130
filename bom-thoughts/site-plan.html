        This is an introduction to the Book of Mormon for anyone who may be curious to learn more. The Book of Mormon is one of the most important aspects of the gospel as taught in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is, as we call it, the “keystone” of our religion - meaning it holds it all together as the keystone in an arch holds up the two sides. It was translated through the power of God from ancient texts written by people in the Americas from 600 BC to about 400 AD. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has many teachings, with the Book of Mormon at its core. There is a great responsibility for each member to read and study this book, since its truthfulness testifies of many things: the restoration of God’s priesthood, the calling of His prophet, the reorganization of His church, and more. All of this occurred while the Book of Mormon was being translated by Joseph Smith, through the power of God. If it is true, it is because God led him to restore His church and was with him throughout the whole process.

      <h3>A Comparison</h3>
      <p>
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the church of Jesus Christ reorganized on this earth. Its members follow Christ and claim to adhere to His teachings. With this in mind. It’s important to note that the members of the Church do believe in the Holy Bible – both the Old and New Testaments. But, they also believe that the Book of Mormon contains the word of God. In fact, it is a pillar of belief that, as time goes on, Christ reveals more of His gospel to His people, and that the Book of Mormon is the biggest thing revealed in this time to uncover more of the gospel. There are some things that are unclear or not included at all in the Bible which are explained in the Book of Mormon.
Hand in hand, these two religious texts compliment each other. All Christians know that Christ lived at a certain time and in a certain place, and that time and place are talked about at length in the Bible. That is where His life is laid out for believers to study. The Book of Mormon, then, does not talk about this (having taken place in America), but instead is given through the view point of other prophet called by God. Two peoples, two different sides of the world, but the same gospel.

      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Kimball Christensen. I have grown up a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was baptized at eight years old, and since then I have stayed active in the church. Ever since I can remember, the Book of Mormon has been taught as a significant part of my relationship with Christ. Many people are under the impression that in the Church, there is a lot of pressure to live a certain way. I have always made the choice, however, to find the truth for myself by studying Christian texts and then asking God for His help in revealing the truth to me.
As I have done this throughout my life, I have come to know more about God’s plan for me. My study of the Book of Mormon has allowed me to come closer to Christ and feel His love more often. I know that there are many like me out there who have found the same peace in life through their honest, faith-filled efforts to know the truth. I suggest that any and all who have a need for this in their life do the same thing.
